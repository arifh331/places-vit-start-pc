# Fantasy Travel Journal

A web-page that details and visualizes some of the most iconic settings in popular culture in a responsive and fashionable design. Built with React, JavaScript, Vite, Axios, GPT-4, HTML/CSS.

## Project Overview

This web-page was a project where I wanted to use my React and front-design skills to create a visually pleasing travel journal of places I had visited. However, realizing I hadn't visited many extraordinary places, I decided to create a fantasy travel journal showcasing iconic locations I would like to visit.

I decided to take it a step further and make it more dynamic by connecting the page to the GPT-4 API. This integration allows the generation of images for these iconic locations using artificial intelligence. If the viewer isn't satisfied with the generated image, they can simply click the button to regenerate a new image.

Come and explore these fantastic places, and see if they match your imagination!
